<div id="well-now-get-started-with-a-discussion-of-how-learning-works" class="section level1">
<h1>We’ll now get started with a discussion of how learning works</h1>
<p>This training course introduces participants to the basics of educational psychology, instructional design, and how these things apply to teaching programming16–20. It is necessarily very shallow, but most participants find the material interesting as well as useful. Introducing grad students and faculty to evidence-based teaching practices may turn out to be Software Carpentry’s greatest contribution.</p>
<p>Learning results from what the student does and thinks. - Herbert A. Simon</p>
<p>"Learning as a <em>process</em> that leads to <em>change</em>, which occurs as a result of <em>experience</em> and increases the potential for improved performance and future learning (adapted from Mayer, 2002).</p>
<p>_ The Carpentries Pedagogical Model_</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Carpentries workshop is an interactive event – for learners and instructors.</li>
<li>We give and receive feedback throughout the course of a workshop.</li>
</ul>
<div id="adquisition-of-a-skill" class="section level2">
<h2>Adquisition of a Skill</h2>
<p>Dreyfuss model of Skill adquisition. This work indicates that through practice and formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance from Novice to expert.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/skill-level.svg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">personas</p>
</div>
<p>Novice: someone who doesn’t know what they don’t know, i.e., they don’t yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices.</p>
<div id="exercise-write-one-topic-you-consider-yourself-a-novice-and-one-you-consider-yourself-a-competent-practicioner" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Write one topic you consider yourself a novice and one you consider yourself a competent practicioner</h3>
<p>3min</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="cognitive-development-and-mental-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Cognitive Development and Mental Models</h2>
<p>Mental models are what the person believes about a system. These models are not just based on facts but are instead contructed primarily on the person’s previous experiences and what they think they know about the sytem. People base their actions according to their mental models. When a system doesn’t work the way they expect they get confused, and that builds frustration.</p>
<p>Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a well-founded mental model. A mental model is a collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships between those concepts, which a person has about a topic.</p>
<p>Mental models get more complex with adquisition of skills. <img src="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/mental_models.svg" alt="Mental models" /></p>
<p>Most learners coming to Carpentries lessons are novices, and do not have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our primary goal is not to teach the syntax of a particular programming language, but to help them construct a working mental model so that they have something to attach facts to. In other words, our goal is to teach people how to think about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to learn more on their own or understand what they might find online.</p>
<div id="exercise-your-mental-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Your Mental Models</h3>
<p>5 min. In the Etherpad, write or share your visualisation of your primary research domain or area of expertise and some aspects of the mental model you use to frame and understand your work. What concepts/categories/facts are included? What types of relationships are included?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-importance-of-going-slowly" class="section level3">
<h3>The Importance of Going Slowly</h3>
<p>Goal: healp learners form the right categories and make connections among concepts. We don’t want to overload them with too many unrelated facts, as this will be confusing.</p>
<p>_ An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace at which we teach._</p>
<p>Learning consists of more than “just” building mental models and adding information to them; - creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important. - Explicitly referring back pre-learned concepts when introducing new concepts helps solidify both ideas.</p>
<p>_ Meeting Learners where they are at: teaching relevant and useful skills building an inclusive learning environment, and continually getting (and paying attention to!) feedback from learners._</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-knowledge-gets-in-the-way" class="section level2">
<h2>How “Knowledge” Gets in the Way</h2>
<p>One important action is to address the misconceptions of broken mental models. Three types of misconceptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple factual errors, such as believing that Sydney is the capital of Australia. These are the easiest to correct.</li>
<li>Broken models, such as believing that the probability of 8 is equal to the probablibily of 2 when rolling two dices. We can address these by having learners reason through examples to see contradictions.</li>
<li>Fundamental beliefs, such as “the world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect the planet’s climate”. These beliefs are deeply connected to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Carpentries workshops are focused on novices, and the building of strong mental models, we’re most interested in the middle category of misconceptions. While teaching, we want to expose learners’ broken models so that we can help them build better ones.</p>
<p>One way of establishing this framework is to have students create “concept maps,” an approach pioneered by Novak and Gowin (1984). With this technique, students learn to visualize a group of concepts and their interrelationships. Boxes containing nouns (and sometimes adjectives) are connected to related terms with a series of lines; prepositions or verbs are superimposed on the connecting lines to help clarify the relationship.</p>
<p><em>Callout: Meeting Learners Where They Are </em></p>
</div>
<div id="identifying-and-correcting-misconceptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Identifying and Correcting Misconceptions</h2>
<p><em>Feedback</em></p>
<p>Callout: Summative Assessment<br />
Summative assessment is used to judge whether a learner has reached an acceptable level of competence. Learners either “pass” or “fail” a summative assessment. One example is a driving exam, which tells the rest of society whether someone can safely be allowed on the road. Most assessment done in university courses is summative, and is used to assign course grades.</p>
<p>Callout: Formative assessment Formative assessment takes place during teaching and learning. It sounds like a fancy term, but it can be used to describe any interaction or activity that provides feedback to both instructors and learners about learners’ level of understanding of the material. For learners, this feedback can help focus their study efforts. For instructors, it allows them to refocus their instruction to respond to challenges that learners are facing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsons Problems are effective because they allow students to concentrate on control flow (“what order do I do things?”) separately from vocabulary (“what do I need to do?”).</li>
<li>Multiple choice</li>
<li>minimal fixes</li>
<li>write and run</li>
</ul>
<div id="exercise-identify-the-misconceptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Identify the Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Discuss in groups of three. Choose one wrong answer and write in the Etherpad what the misconception is associated with that wrong answer. This discussion should take about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Q. Find any empty files starting from the current directory and looking in its subfolders.</p>
<pre><code>A) find -type f . -empty
B) find -r . -type f -empty
C) find . -type -empty
D) find . -type f -empty</code></pre>
<p>A good MCQ tests for conceptual misunderstanding rather than simple factual knowledge. If you are having a hard time coming up with diagnostic distractors, then either you need to think more about your learners’ mental models, or your question simply isn’t a good starting point for an MCQ. When you are trying to come up with distractors, think about questions that learners asked or problems they had the last time you taught this subject. If you haven’t taught it before, think about your own misconceptions or ask colleagues about their experiences.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-formative-assessments" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Formative Assessments</h3>
<p>3min. Based on your previous educational experience (or even this training so far!) what types of formative assessments do you know about?</p>
<p>Have each person in the group name one.</p>
<p>Formative assessments <a href="https://www.wabisabilearning.com/blog/formative-assessment-examples" class="uri">https://www.wabisabilearning.com/blog/formative-assessment-examples</a></p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-handling-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Handling Outcomes</h3>
<p>4min. Formative assessments allow us as instructors to adapt our instruction to our audience. What should we do as instructors if the class chooses:</p>
<pre><code>A) mostly one of the wrong answers?
B) mostly the right answer?
C) an even spread among options?





If the majority of the class votes for a single wrong answer, you should go back and work on correcting that particular misconception.
If most of the class votes for the right answer, it’s probably safe to move on.
If answers are pretty evenly split between options, learners are probably guessing randomly and it’s a good idea to go back to a point where everyone was on the same page.</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exercise-modeling-novice-mental-models" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: Modeling Novice Mental Models</h3>
<p>Take 10 minutes to create a multiple choice question related to a topic you intend to teach. Type it into the Etherpad and explain the diagnostic power of each its distractors, i.e., what misconception is each distractor meant to identify?</p>
<p><em>Frequent formative assessments</em></p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-how-many" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise: How Many?</h3>
<p>The Carpentries use formative assessments often. How many have we done since the start of this workshop? Put your guess in the Etherpad along with one example and the purpose that assessment served.</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 3 minutes.</p>
<p><em>Callout: A Corollary Regarding Novices </em><br />
Learners are commonly far too satisfied to not understand key points and remain confused. If learners remain confused, they are far less likely to adopt our “good enough” practices at the conclusion of the workshop. Encourage helpers to support confused learners as far as possible within the flow of the workshop.</p>
