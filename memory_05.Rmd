## Active learning

Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly. - _Waldrop, Nature 2015_

## Concept maps

limiting concepts

emphasis on relationships between concepts, and multiple parents per node

### Activity read
[Concept maps vs mind maps characteristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cognitive-mind-concept/) and [video](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/visual-mapping-strategies/)

### Exercise 

10 min. Draw a concept map of your topic to teach, start with a question 
Include 7 (+ - 4) concepts
Include relationships as action verbs between these concepts
Arrange it in a hierarchical structure with the key concepts on top.

### Exercise 

8 min. In a group of 3 exchange concept maps. Do not explain the map.
- Write one thing you are confused/not sure about the map
- Write one thing you like/it is clear about the map 
- Each person will give and receive two feedbacks: Positive and Negative on content 



## Guided practice

[Coding exercises](http://third-bit.com/2017/10/16/exercise-types.html) from Greg Wilson 

### Exercise: Create a Faded Example from a Lesson (Optional)   
The following exercise should be done in groups of 2-3.
  

    Pick a block of code from an existing Carpentries lesson, or from another lesson you have taught recently.
    Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
    Write a question to test the learnerâ€™s ability to correctly fill in that blank.
    Paste your faded example in the Etherpad.

  
This exercise should take about 10 minutes.
